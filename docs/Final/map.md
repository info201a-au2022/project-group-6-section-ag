## Summary

To find out the relationship between video games and happiness scores, we made two maps, one for the world happiness score and one for the money spent on games per person. By comparing the maps, we can see that in North America and Australia, people spend more money on games, and most of the countries have a pretty high happiness score. For Asia, most countries have a lower happiness score with less money spent on video games per person. From this, we can infer that if the people in a country spend more money on video, that country would often have a higher happiness score.
