    Video games are played everywhere in the world. We play video games because they are fun and bring people joy. For our project, we are analyzing video games. We want to understand what types of video games that people play and enjoy, and find differences between those in different regions around the world. By analyzing these, we can find out what exactly most people enjoy about video games, and help stakeholders like developers make those games. We understand that people play video games for enjoyment, but we also want to see if playing video games also has some other benefits. Happiness is a fundamental need for a person to live, so we will be looking into the relationship between video games and happiness. To be able to answer our questions, we are looking into several datasets, such as Video game sales and ratings, Steam store data, and the World Happiness report. Some key findings that we have identified are that games that are rated highly by the players also sell well, regions that have higher happiness scores also have more video games sold, and genres that a lot of people buy and enjoy are action and sport games.

    To be able to look at the relationship between video game sales and the playerâ€™s rating, we decided to use a scatter plot. The rating of a video game can tell us the enjoyment the game provided to the player. By looking at a scatter plot, we can identify if there are any correlations between what a video game scored and how well it sold. In the plot, we can see that the majority of games sell between 0 and 10 million, with some outliers selling over 10 million. By looking in the range where the majority of the games are, we can better see the way how scores and sales of video games correlate. We can see that as video games score higher, the sales also increase. From this, we can infer that if players enjoy a game, it will sell better.

  p("One of the questions that we asked was: How does genre affect video game popularity and how does this differ across different platforms? We used the total sales of games of each genre on each platform to find the popularity of video game genres on different platforms. From this we found that different platforms differ greatly in what genres are popular. For example, for the Wii, the most popular genre is sports and shooter is one of the least popular genres. While for the Xbox 360 and PC, shooters are one of the most popular genres whereas sports is either somewhat popular or unpopular. The reason that this data is significant, is that it could be useful to people who are looking to purchase a gaming system by helping them to decide which gaming system is right for them or for developers trying to choose a platform for their game."),

We decided to use scatter plots to demonstrate if there is any correlation between score and ratings. We wanted to see if sales are a good indicator of what people like. The majority of the sales is between 0 and 10 million sales, with some outliers outside the range. We can see that sales tend to increase as ratings increase. Looking at the scatter plot, we can see that both user scores and critic's scores have a weak positive correlation with the number of sales. However, critic's scores appear to have a greater positive correlation with the number of sales, especially at the higher range of critic's scores (80-100). For this higher range we can see that a higher critic score seems to be associated with a much higher amount of sales."),

  p("The last question we asked was: How does video game expenditure affect the happiness score for a region? In order to answer this question we used two datasets. We decided to use heatmaps of the video game expenditure and happiness scores for countries across the world so that we could see if there were any correlation between the two. From this we found that a higher video game expenditure seems to be roughly correlated with a higher happiness score for a country. This correlation can be seen across several continents including North America, Europe, Australia, and Africa. The first three of these continents have both a higher than average expenditure on video games and a higher than average happiness score. Africa on the other hand has both a lower than average expenditure on video games and a lower than average happiness score. In contrast, there are also several continents that do not exhibit this correlation very well. For example, many countries in both South America and Asia have a relatively low expenditure on video games, but either average or above average happiness scores. From this analysis, we can infer that if the people in a country spend more money on video, that country would often have a higher happiness score, however the correlation is not strong as there are other factors that lead to higher happiness score, or expenditure on video games."),
