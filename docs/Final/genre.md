## Summary

To find out which type of genres people like to play, we made a bar graph that shows the relationship between video game sales and genre by different video game platforms. For example, the Wiiâ€™s most popular genre is sports, while shooter games are one of the least popular genres. We believe it could be helpful to people looking to purchase a gaming system by helping them decide which gaming system is right for them or for developers trying to choose a platform for their game.
