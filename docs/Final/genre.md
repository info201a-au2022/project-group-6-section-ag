## Summary

To find the popularity of video game genres on different platforms by using the total sales of games of each genre, we made a bar graph that shows the video game sales on different platforms based on genre. Use Wii for an example; the most popular genre is sports, and the shooter is one of the least popular genres. We believe it could be helpful to people looking to purchase a gaming system by helping them decide which gaming system is right for them.
