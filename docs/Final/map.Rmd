## Summary

To find out the relationship between video games and happiness scores, we compared two maps, one looking at the world happiness score and the other looking at the money spent on games per person. By comparing the maps, we can see that in North America and Australia, people spend more money on games, and have a high happiness score. Most countries in Asia have a lower happiness score and less money spent on video games per person. From this, we can infer that countries that spend more money on and play video games are more likely to be happier.
